                    <h2>Invitation to Participate and Description of Project</h2>
                    <p>
                        You are invited to participate in a research study by Yale University, designed to examine how we make decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to decide whether you wish to be a part of this research study, you should know enough
                        about its risks and benefits to make an informed judgment. This consent form gives you detailed
                        information about the research study, which should go over all aspects of this research: its purpose,
                        the procedures that will be performed, any risks of the procedures, and possible benefits. Once you
                        understand the study, you will be asked if you wish to participate; if so, you will be asked to sign
                        this form.
                        
                    </p>
                    <h2>Description of Procedures</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you agree to participate, you will first be asked to complete a computer task in which you will 
                        make a series of choices between pairs of lotteries. You will be asked to choose which of the two lotteries you prefer.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the computer task, one of the choices you made will be randomly chosen and
                        played out. Winning the chosen lottery may result in a real bonus payment equivalent to half
                        the lottery’s payout.                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, you will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires that will include questions about your opinions, 
                        daily life, and experiences. You will also be asked to provide your ZIP code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The study will take about fifteen to twenty minutes to complete. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Risks and Inconveniences</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are no known risks associated with subjects’ participation in this survey beyond those 
                        associated with working at a computer terminal for a period of about fifteen to twenty minutes. 
                        You will be able to take short breaks from time to time if needed.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Benefits</h2>
                    <p>
                        There will be no direct benefits to you for participating in this study. 
                        However, the results may be of benefit to others by contributing to our 
                        understanding of how decision-making processes are implemented.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Economic Considerations</h2>
                    <p>
                        There will be no cost to you associated with participation in this study. 
                        For your participation, you will receive at least $2.50 through Amazon Mechanical Turk, 
                        and you may also receive an additional payment of up to $18 based on your bonus payment
                        outcome in the random actualized trial. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
                    <p>
                        The online survey will be anonymous; no identifiable information will be obtained.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Voluntary Participation and Withdrawal</h2>
                    <p>
                        Participating in this study is voluntary. 
                        You are free to choose not to take part in this study. 
                        Refusing to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are 
                        otherwise entitled (such as your health care outside the study, 
                        the payment for your health care, and your health care benefits). 
                        However, you will not be able to enroll in this research study and will not receive 
                        study procedures as a study participant if you do not allow use of your information 
                        as part of this study. Consider this research and the consent form carefully – 
                        for as long as you feel is necessary – before you decide.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Authorization</h2>
